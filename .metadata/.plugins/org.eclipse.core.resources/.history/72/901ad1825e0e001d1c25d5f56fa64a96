//ArrayList uses an array to store the objects.Access is very fast because it can internally use the array index to locate the object.
//At the same time,insertions and deletions are very slow,it will reshuffle the entire array
//Initial capacity is 1
//Use ArrayList,If we want to do a lot of read operations
