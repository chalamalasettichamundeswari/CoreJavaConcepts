Components of a JVM:
Class Loader Subsystem->responsible for loading the java .class into the memory.
Once loaded,we need multiple memory areas starting with method area,heap area,stack area,PC Registers and Native Method 
Execution Engine
JNI->If we want to invoke methods in other programming languages such as c and c++.
Native Method Libraries

Class loader System  ->JVM first checks if the class is already in the method area.if not it will ask class loader system to load the class.

Class loader System ->Application Class loader
The class loader system will ask the application class loader to load the class.
