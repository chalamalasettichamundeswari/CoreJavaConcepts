Collections is a class contain only static methods
Collection is an interface contain static,default,abstract methods
java.util.Collection ->Interfaces are List(Allows duplicate objects),Set(Doesn't Allow duplicate objects),Queue(FIFO)
Interface List ->classes are ArrayList,LinkedList,vector
Interface Set->class is HashSet(subclass is LinkedHashSet),Interface is SortedSet(subclass is TreeSet)
Interface Queue->sub class is priority queue

Collections -> A map interface is implemented by hashmap(subclass is linkedhashmap).sortedmap(interface) subclass is treemap

Our class should implement the Comparable Interface(java.lang) or provide the implementation
