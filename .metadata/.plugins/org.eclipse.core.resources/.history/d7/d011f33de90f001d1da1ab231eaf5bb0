Collections is a class contain only static methods
Collection is an interface contain static,default,abstract methods
java.util.Collection ->Interfaces are List(Allows duplicate objects),Set(Doesn't Allow duplicate objects),Queue(FIFO)
Interface List ->classes are ArrayList,LinkedList,vector
Interface Set->class is HashSet(subclass is LinkedHashSet),Interface is SortedSet(subclass is TreeSet)
Interface Queue->sub class is priority queue

Collections -> A map interface is implemented by hashmap(subclass is linkedhashmap).sortedmap(interface) subclass is treemap

Comparable and Comparator Interfaces

when we add our objects to collections such as TreeSet and TreeMap which sort them we need to provide the natural sorting order so that the sorting will happen
Our class should implement the Comparable Interface(java.lang) or provide the implementation or override the compareTo method and provide the implementation for it.
This method is invoked by one object and another object is passed it as parameter
-ve value if obj1 has to come before obj2
+ve value if obj1 has to come after obj2
0 if both obj1 and obj2 are same
If we want to change the sorting order at a point later on we use Comparator Interface(java.lang).Here implement the compare methods
-ve value if obj1 has to come before obj2
+ve value if obj1 has to come after obj2
0 if both obj1 and obj2 are same

Inbuilt classes such as String and all the wrapper classes such as Integer,Float etc already implement the compareTo method.whereas StringBuffer doesnot.

Map is an interface of its own.It doesnot implement the collection interface.
Map is implemented by classes like HashMap.extended by interface called SortedMap
SortedMap which is implemented by NavigationalMAp implemented by TreeMAp.
